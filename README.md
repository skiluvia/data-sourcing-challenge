# Data-Sourcing-Challenge
## Module 6 Challenge (data-sourcing-challenge)

## Background
This is to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. We will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
