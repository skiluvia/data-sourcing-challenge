# Data-Sourcing-Challenge
## Module 6 Challenge (data-sourcing-challenge)

## Background
This is to prepare some data for a recommended system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. We will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.

## The New York Times Movide Review
We will be searching the New York Times database for all movies reviews between **03/01/2013** and **05/31/2023**. We will put the results into a dataframe. Each nove will have an ID and bunch of other details.

## The Movie Database
We will use the Movie ID we got from the New York Times search to gather more details of the movies. Additional information we want to capture is **title**, **original_title**, **budget**, **original_language**, **homepage**, **overview**, **popularity**, **runtime**, **revenue**, **release_date**, **vote_average**, **vote_count**, as well as the **genres**, **spoken_languages**, and **production_countries**. We will also show whether the movie was found or not.

## Merging and Cleaning the Data for Export
We will merge both of these results and export to a CSV file.

## Summary
In this challenge we have learned mainly what we need in order to make and how to make API calls and using dataframe to make decisions on the date we get.
